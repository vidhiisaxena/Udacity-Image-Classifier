# Image-Classifier
AI with Python nanodegree final project, In this project we implemented an image classification application. This application will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It will then use the trained model to classify new images.

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using a dataset of 102 flower categories. Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name i.e. it returns the flower name and class probability
